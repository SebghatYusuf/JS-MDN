# APIs in client-side JavaScript

## 2 Types of API in JS 

Browser APIs :  <br/>
are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser â€” taking an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc. In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++ or Rust) to do the actual audio processing. But again, this complexity is abstracted away from you by the API.

Third-party APIs <br/>
are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation) allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website. It provides a special set of constructs you can use to query the Twitter service and return specific information.
